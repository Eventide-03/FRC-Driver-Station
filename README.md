# FRC-Driver-Station
What is a driver station? At competitions, teams regularly have to transport their robot and operating devices from the pits (where they keep their robots) to the field (where they play matches). A driver station is meant to hold all the operating devices such as a laptop, controllers, cables, extra tools, and whatnot in a securely fitted fashion.
